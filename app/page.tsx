          Hey, hi! My name is John and I&apos;m a web developer. I make things,
          and I try to be considerate when making them. This website is where I
          explain what those things are, and how I am thinking about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m currently working on Ex Libris RPG, a directory of
          third-party content created for great indie roleplaying games, like
          MÃ¶rk Borg and Mausritter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I&apos;m rebuilding this personal website of mine to try
          and explain a bit more about my process. A lot of thought goes into
          these things and I&apos;d love to make it easier for others to follow
          along.
